Simple E-shop created using Spring server, derbyDB and Angular with REST API design. I created the project as a school project where I also wanted to learn how to work with said frameworks.

"Codes" folder includes production version of Eshop

"Finished eshop" folder includes deployment version of Eshop
In order to run the files in this folder, the server and database are run from their respective .bat files while the website itself ("Finished eshop/Angular files") needs to be deployed on server (for example Apache).
