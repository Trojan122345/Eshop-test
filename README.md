Simple E-shop created using Spring server, derbyDB and Angular. I created the project to learn how these frameworks work and am currently working on a new version that would work on my new system.

"Codes" folder includes production version of Eshop

"Finished eshop" folder includes deployment version of Eshop
In order to run the files in this folder, the server and database are run from their respective .bat files while the vebsite itself ("Finished eshop/Angular files") needs to be deployed on server (for example Apache).
